# VoxAssist Project Status Report

## 1. Project Overview

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the VoxAssist project, detailing its current status, completed features, and areas for future improvement. The analysis was conducted by comparing the existing codebase against the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to ensure alignment with the project's goals.

## 2. Completed Features

The following features have been fully implemented and are functioning as expected:

- **AI-Powered Voice Conversations**: The core voice AI functionality is in place, utilizing the Gemini API for natural language understanding and the ElevenLabs API for realistic text-to-speech conversion.
- **Real-time Call Monitoring**: The frontend includes a live call monitoring page that displays a real-time transcript, sentiment analysis, and call status updates.
- **Demo Mode**: A fully functional demo mode allows users to explore the platform's features without requiring API keys or a live phone number.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication is implemented with JWT tokens and password hashing.
- **Database Migration**: The backend has been successfully migrated from MySQL to PostgreSQL with Prisma, ensuring a robust and scalable data layer.

## 3. Implemented Improvements and New Features

During this review, the following improvements and new features were implemented:

- **Code Quality Enhancements**: Several minor issues, including unused variables and commented-out code, were addressed to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Configuration UI for Support Topics**: A new settings page allows administrators to define and manage support topics, including keywords and response scripts.
- **Configuration UI for Escalation Rules**: A new settings page enables administrators to create and manage rules for escalating calls to human agents based on sentiment or keywords.
- **Real-time Call Visualization**: The live call monitoring page now includes a real-time waveform animation, providing a more engaging and futuristic user experience.
- **Post-Call Surveys**: A new post-call survey feature has been implemented to gather customer feedback via SMS, a key metric for measuring success.

## 4. Identified Areas for Improvement

The following areas have been identified for future improvement:

- **Client-Side Filtering**: The admin users page currently handles filtering on the client side, which is inefficient for large datasets. This should be updated to use backend filtering for improved performance.
- **Mock Data Usage**: Several pages in the admin dashboard, including the health and notifications pages, currently rely on mock data. These should be updated to fetch and display real data from the backend.
- **Incomplete Filter Functionality**: The audit logs page includes UI elements for filtering, but the functionality has not been implemented. This should be connected to the backend to allow for proper log filtering.

## 5. Next Steps

To complete the project and prepare it for deployment, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Implement Backend Functionality for New Features**: Connect the new settings pages for support topics and escalation rules to the backend to save and retrieve configurations from the database.
2. **Address Identified Areas for Improvement**: Implement the backend filtering and data fetching required to address the issues identified in the admin dashboard.
3. **Thorough Testing**: Conduct comprehensive testing of all features, including the new additions, to ensure a stable and bug-free user experience.
4. **Deployment**: Once all features are implemented and tested, the application can be deployed to a production environment.
